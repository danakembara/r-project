# This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and 
# Polished': Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found 
# here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). The purpose of 
# this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe 
# and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question: "In what 
# ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?"

# 1. In the "member_casual" column, there are 2 names for members("member" and
# "subscriber") and 2 names for casual riders("Customer" and "casual"), so we
# need to consolidate them
# 2. The data is too granular, we need to add some additional columns such as
# "day", "month", and "year" so we can calculate the ride length in seconds
# 3. Add a calculated field for length of ride since the data q1_2020 did not
# have "tripduration" column. We will add "ride_length" to entire new table for
# consistency
# 4. There are some rides where tripduration shows up as a negative, we will
# eliminate these "bad data"
